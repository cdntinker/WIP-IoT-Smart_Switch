To Be Done:
* Firmware update needs help...
* Button Handling!!!
  * Getting there...
  * AAARRRGGG... Is it bouncing or is it sending the MQTT twice???
* Sensor handling
* Battery monitoring
* Figure out a way to indicate active-low/active-high in the device descriptions
  * Maybe something involving negative numbers for the I/O numbers?
* Swap positions of 'ESP8266 Reboot' & 'Factory Reset' buttons on 'Management' page
* Add a "Reboot" MQTT message
